WAP that defines a function called frequency() which computes the frequency of words present in a sentence passed to it.The frequencies should be returned in sorted order of words in the sentence
def frequency(s):
  freq={}
  for word in s.split():
    freq[word]=freq.get(word,0)+1
  return freq
s=input("enter the sentence")
d=frequency(s)
words=sorted(d)
for w in words:
  print('%s:%d'%(w,d[w]))
